    Currently, the government standards call for that sharing through APIs, but perhaps there is a simpler and more practical option? 
    At the moment this page represents nothing more than exploration of what's possible and it doesn't intend to be a full dataset.

Fllowing [GDS Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard), [Point 12](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard/point-12-make-new-source-code-open) Civil Service produced many open repositories with code relating to the services they provide. 

This collection provides a list of github accounts with such code as a starting point for anybody who wants to explore what is there. 

Some of the government organisations are listed at [government.github.com](https://government.github.com/community). Unfortunately, not all accounts created by cross government communities are eligable for inclusion there.
